# ARCHIVE NOTE
Because of the hotfix patch of 42.20.4 and the knee-jerk removal of `loadstring` for "security-reasons", This anti-cheat is no-longer possible to run. If you need to generate code, you will need to do it in the workshop mod itself, exposing this algorithm to cheat clients to bypass. The only solution is to frequently update your code to avoid lua-bouncers and perform heart-beat checks to check for non-valid responses.

**I am not updating this mod. Use this code at your own risk.**

## About
EtherHammerX is a client-side anti-cheat framework for the game Project Zomboid. The framework aims to:
- Provide "out-of-the-box" anti-cheat protection against cheats like **EtherHack**.
- Fight anti-cheat tampering & bypassing.
- Provide servers with customizable and configurable anti-cheat keys & modules.

## Installation
EtherHammerX requires the following workshop items to work:
- [asledgehammer_utilities](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3360195806) (Workshop ID: 3360195806)
- [modloader](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3367051185) (Workshop ID: 3367051185)
- [etherhammerx](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3367055125) (Workshop ID: 3367055125)

> **NOTE**: These utilities are separate workshop mods so modders can use them for other projects.

Next, download the files in this repository. Create a directory on your server's  `Zomboid/` folder `Zomboid/Lua/ModLoader/mods/EtherHammerX/` and paste the contents of this repository in there.

Lastly, in order for the anti-cheat to kick players, API needs to exist that isn't in the game by default.

Two server-patches provides this API:
- EtherHammerX_Server_Patch (PZ build 41.76.18) (Only adds needed API)
- CraftHammer V1.06_01 (PZ build 41.76.18) (A full server-side anti-cheat)

> **Developer's Note**: *CraftHammer* is a full server framework with a built-in packet analyser for hackers trying to manipulate the network to gain access to cheats and exploits in the game. This is also a dated anti-cheat (3+ years old) and could run into some issues. I'd recommend this however if you don't want this on your server I totally understand. That's why I provide the other option only adding the API to kick and ban players.

## Why is EtherHammerX installed this way?
This design allows EtherHammerX to send managed and compiled code to the game's client with layers of added security. The server and client code use generative values that only work for both player sessions and single server-cycles. Static workshop files can be easily read, overwritten, and disabled. A lot more work is required to reverse-engineer this framework because of how it is designed, **even if it's open-source.** 

This design also allows servers to **customize their security and add their own anti-cheat modules**, with or without my help. Diversity and open-source security allows servers to take matters into their own hands.

## Customization & Development
EtherHammerX is built around open-source security and customization. Customization and additional modules allows servers to take security into their own hands. Refer to the Wiki in this repository for help on customization and development of anti-cheat modules for your server.
